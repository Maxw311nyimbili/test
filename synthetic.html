            <h3>What  is Synthetic Biology</h3>
            <p>Synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary field of research that seeks to create or redesign 
                biological systems from the smallest constituent parts possible, such as DNA, proteins, and other
                organic molecules. Synthetic biology applies engineering principles such as standardization, 
                modularity, and abstraction to genetic manipulation,
                viewing genes and other DNA features as "parts" and cells as "molecular machines.</p>

            <h3>Techniques used in Synthetic Biology</h3>
            <p> Techniques used in synthetic biology include gene splicing, metabolic engineering and directed evolution. Furthermore, 
                industrial biotech scientists and other biotech companies have been utilizing theses forms of synthetic biology for years. </p>

            <h3>Applications of Synthetic Biology</h3>
            <p>Synthetic biology has the potential to advance various applications, 
                such as nutrition, safety, and manufacturing, by expanding the breadth 
                of biology from existing and natural systems to non-natural and viable systems. These applications can 
            be extended to the medical field in assisting with finding ways to effects elimainate diseases including but not limited to
        cancer, coronary heart diseases, diabetes, as well as Alzheimer's disease</p>
